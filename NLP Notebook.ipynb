I was really suprised to see it had given me almost 8,000 steps, 3.24 miles, 134 floors, & way more calories thank I burned while I was sitting in my car.  I looked on the forum to see how to easily delete the steps, miles, floors, and calories so my data would be accurate.  The only way people are fixing it is by manually logging the activity \"Automobile or light truck (not a semi) driving\" and entering in the duration.  I think that is a cumbersome way to fix the issue everytime I drive because I have to make sure I write down what time I get into and out of my car so I know the start time and duration.  And how does it automatically know the calories burned when everyone burns calories when they are sedentary at different rates.

You could access the \"Drive Mode\" either on your Fitbit One or on your phone app to turn it on/off.  If you have a Fitbit One you could press the button till the \"Drive Mode\" icon appears then hold the button down for 2 seconds to turn it on or off.     On the phone apps you would just go to your device under \"Account\" and there you could turn it on or off.

      "{'Date': '11-24-2019', 'Comment': 'My suggestion is specific to the existing \"Sleep Goals\" functionality in the app.   The current functionality is very manual and not very insightful or helpful. For example, I have to manually specify my Sleep Goal (time asleep in hours/minutes), and separately I manually specify my Target Sleep Schedule by entering Bedtime and Wake up Time.  Whatever you enter for Target Sleep Schedule isn\\'t in any way connected to your sleep goal.   My suggestion is to make the app more helpful by incorporating logic to the Target Sleep Schedule functionality in the app in order to help you meet your sleep goal.  Specifically, the app should be able to calculate the Target Sleep Schedule Bedtime after you enter your Time Asleep Goal and Wake up Time.   For example: Let\\'s say I set my Time Asleep Goal to 8 hours of sleep per night.  I specify my Target Sleep Schedule Wake up Time as 7:00am. On average looking at my sleep data I spend roughly 1 hour per night restless/awake.   It should be smart enough to automatically calculate what time you should go to bed in order to meet your sleep goal.  The formula is very simple:  Wake Up Time - (Time Asleep Goal + Avg Time Awake/Restless)   Using my specific example above, I specify a Time Asleep Goal of 8 hours, and my sleep data suggests I spend an hour on average restless/awake each night.  That means I need 8+1 = 9 hours of time in bed in order to meet my Time Asleep Goal of 8 hours.  If I specify 7:00am as my Wake up Time, then to calculate Bedtime would be 7:00am - 9 hours = 10:00pm the night before. This means in order to meet my sleep goal for the night, I need to be in bed no later than 10pm. The app should be smart enough to automatically calculate 10:00pm as my Sleep Schedule Bedtime instead of forcing the user to manually do the math to figure out their sleep schedule.', 'Sentiment': 'Positive'}\n",

Now I'm healthy and building muscle like there's no tomorrow. I love fit bits, I think their a great gadget for fitness, but I can't use mine because the calorie feature makes me feel the need to restrict my intake. I am not blaming the company for this, for some counting calories is very important in their journey to health, but to some its detrimental.

For example, there are currently two 'heart' images in Fitbit OS. One is a solid heart while the other is a heart outline. Both of these could easily be reproduced using a single svg path element and changing a single attribute to switch between a solid or outline heart.   Svg elements can also be scaled and rendered any size without losing quality.

Upon reading your docs, I discovered that only alerts which have been read/viewed in the Fitbit app are returned by the API. While I understand that the Fitbit app is meant to be the primary entry point for viewing these important notifications, my father often misses them as: The sheer number of notifications from various apps can overwhelm him, causing important Afib alerts to be missed/overlooked His reduced dexterity and vision, combined with working memory challenges, make it difficult for him to navigate and manage notifications on his smartphone The small text, icons, and complex navigation within the notification center can make it hard for him to notice and interact with critical alerts Meanwhile, he is very comfortable using Gmail, which he checks multiple times a day. So having an Afib alert delivered via e-mail could potentially be a lifesaver. In addition, this would allow me to keep tabs on his Afib notifications without having to worry about whether he has viewed the list of Afib notifications in the Fitbit app. Please would you consider changing this API restriction?

I think we need the following enhancements to the SDK:   Provide a way that the clock face code can access the Reminders to Move preferences that were set by the user, e.g. the start and end times. Provide a way that the clock face code can obtain the exact values that the Today app is displaying, otherwise the new clock face app will appear broken if a user compares the values. Regarding the second item, what I'm looking for is a way to obtain the exact same counts, including previous hours, so that if a user installs a new clock face with Reminders to Move displayed and then goes to the Today app they will see the same thing.  I think the only way to currently implement the Reminders is to have the new clock face start counting when it is installed so it will not display the correct value for the current hour nor can it display how many previous hours were met or missed.  Note that this should work no matter when the device was last synced, so the hourly counts probably need to come directly from the device and not from the web API.

It messes up the speed metrics which are kept. It would not be fair if I, a less fit 58-year old, logs a better time for a particular segment just because I can go faster with my e-bike. The work-around is to always remember to change my ride to an \"E-Bike Ride\" before someone sees my unusually fast times and gets upset with me.

I'd like my Ionic apps to be able to send notifications to FitBit's standard notification queue. I'm suggesting a two-part solution:   (1) Allow apps to register a background process function that the FitBit device calls on a regular basis, even when the app is not running. The app would indicate its desired wake-up frequency, but FitBit might want to set a maximum wake-up frequency to limit resource usage.   (2) Allow apps to drop messages into the notification queue that FitBit displays above the clock face. This allows apps to provide notifications without having to write a phone app to push them, which would further clutter the phone's own notification queue.   The max wake-up frequency would determine the kinds of apps that users could write. Once-an-hour wake-up would allow apps to provide reports or reminders. Once-every-N-minutes wake-up would allow apps to monitor progress and make suggestions or provide encouragement. Once-every-minute (or faster) would allow apps to provide real time notifications. Absent this feature, app developers are forced to write their own clock apps to provide app notification services, even when a novelty clock isn't the point of the app. Alternatively, app devs could write mobile phone apps that issue app notices to the FitBit watch, but this clutters up the phone's notification queue. At present, this latter approach also requires round-tripping between the phone app and an Internet server in order to communicate with the companion.   Also, it's ideal that the app be able to do this without the phone (companion) present, so that people can rely on the FitBit without having to always have the phone around.

I was really suprised to see it had given me almost 8,000 steps, 3.24 miles, 134 floors, & way more calories thank I burned while I was sitting in my car.  I looked on the forum to see how to easily delete the steps, miles, floors, and calories so my data would be accurate.  The only way people are fixing it is by manually logging the activity \"Automobile or light truck (not a semi) driving\" and entering in the duration.  I think that is a cumbersome way to fix the issue everytime I drive because I have to make sure I write down what time I get into and out of my car so I know the start time and duration.  And how does it automatically know the calories burned when everyone burns calories when they are sedentary at different rates.   I think they should add a \"Drive Mode\" feature that when turned on it won\\'t add steps, distance, floors, & will only add calories burned equal to you sitting in a chair.   You could access the \"Drive Mode\" either on your Fitbit One or on your phone app to turn it on/off.

For example, I have to manually specify my Sleep Goal (time asleep in hours/minutes), and separately I manually specify my Target Sleep Schedule by entering Bedtime and Wake up Time.  Whatever you enter for Target Sleep Schedule isn\\'t in any way connected to your sleep goal.   My suggestion is to make the app more helpful by incorporating logic to the Target Sleep Schedule functionality in the app in order to help you meet your sleep goal.  Specifically, the app should be able to calculate the Target Sleep Schedule Bedtime after you enter your Time Asleep Goal and Wake up Time.   For example: Let\\'s say I set my Time Asleep Goal to 8 hours of sleep per night.  I specify my Target Sleep Schedule Wake up Time as 7:00am. On average looking at my sleep data I spend roughly 1 hour per night restless/awake.   It should be smart enough to automatically calculate what time you should go to bed in order to meet your sleep goal.  The formula is very simple:  Wake Up Time - (Time Asleep Goal + Avg Time Awake/Restless)   Using my specific example above, I specify a Time Asleep Goal of 8 hours, and my sleep data suggests I spend an hour on average restless/awake each night.  That means I need 8+1 = 9 hours of time in bed in order to meet my Time Asleep Goal of 8 hours.  If I specify 7:00am as my Wake up Time, then to calculate Bedtime would be 7:00am - 9 hours = 10:00pm the night before. This means in order to meet my sleep goal for the night, I need to be in bed no later than 10pm. The app should be smart enough to automatically calculate 10:00pm as my Sleep Schedule Bedtime instead of forcing the user to manually do the math to figure out their sleep schedule.', 'Sentiment': 'Positive'}, {'Date': '11-24-2019', 'Comment': 'Fitbit must think of there own proprietary heartrate band that can be connected to the wearable, so I don’t need to wear the watch Al day , Moderator edit: Clarified subject and updated label', 'Sentiment': 'Positive'}, {'Date': '11-24-2019', 'Comment': 'Just like exercise, please have a way to at least log mindfulness minutes manually.

There is a large library of svg objects that use mostly 'path' elements to define them freely available on the web. By adding support for this, we could create a richer user experience.   It would also be easier to use 'path' elements to draw certain objects that currently require image files (e.g. images of a heart, footsteps, stairs etc.). Image files also use more memory than would be required by an equivalent svg 'path' definition.   Svg 'path' is also more flexible than an image. For example, there are currently two 'heart' images in Fitbit OS. One is a solid heart while the other is a heart outline. Both of these could easily be reproduced using a single svg path element and changing a single attribute to switch between a solid or outline heart.   Svg elements can also be scaled and rendered any size without losing quality. Currently, if you want differently sized images, you will either have a 'large' image that is then scaled down to the required size, or several differently sized images. Both of these options would require more memory than a path definition.

Upon reading your docs, I discovered that only alerts which have been read/viewed in the Fitbit app are returned by the API. While I understand that the Fitbit app is meant to be the primary entry point for viewing these important notifications, my father often misses them as: The sheer number of notifications from various apps can overwhelm him, causing important Afib alerts to be missed/overlooked His reduced dexterity and vision, combined with working memory challenges, make it difficult for him to navigate and manage notifications on his smartphone The small text, icons, and complex navigation within the notification center can make it hard for him to notice and interact with critical alerts Meanwhile, he is very comfortable using Gmail, which he checks multiple times a day. So having an Afib alert delivered via e-mail could potentially be a lifesaver.

I think we need the following enhancements to the SDK:   Provide a way that the clock face code can access the Reminders to Move preferences that were set by the user, e.g. the start and end times. Provide a way that the clock face code can obtain the exact values that the Today app is displaying, otherwise the new clock face app will appear broken if a user compares the values. Regarding the second item, what I'm looking for is a way to obtain the exact same counts, including previous hours, so that if a user installs a new clock face with Reminders to Move displayed and then goes to the Today app they will see the same thing.  I think the only way to currently implement the Reminders is to have the new clock face start counting when it is installed so it will not display the correct value for the current hour nor can it display how many previous hours were met or missed.  Note that this should work no matter when the device was last synced, so the hourly counts probably need to come directly from the device and not from the web API.

I'd like my Ionic apps to be able to send notifications to FitBit's standard notification queue. I'm suggesting a two-part solution:   (1) Allow apps to register a background process function that the FitBit device calls on a regular basis, even when the app is not running. The app would indicate its desired wake-up frequency, but FitBit might want to set a maximum wake-up frequency to limit resource usage.   (2) Allow apps to drop messages into the notification queue that FitBit displays above the clock face. This allows apps to provide notifications without having to write a phone app to push them, which would further clutter the phone's own notification queue.   The max wake-up frequency would determine the kinds of apps that users could write. Once-an-hour wake-up would allow apps to provide reports or reminders. Once-every-N-minutes wake-up would allow apps to monitor progress and make suggestions or provide encouragement. Once-every-minute (or faster) would allow apps to provide real time notifications. Absent this feature, app developers are forced to write their own clock apps to provide app notification services, even when a novelty clock isn't the point of the app. Alternatively, app devs could write mobile phone apps that issue app notices to the FitBit watch, but this clutters up the phone's notification queue. At present, this latter approach also requires round-tripping between the phone app and an Internet server in order to communicate with the companion.   Also, it's ideal that the app be able to do this without the phone (companion) present, so that people can rely on the FitBit without having to always have the phone around.

       "  'I am constantly being awakened in the middle of the night because I have 4-year old twins (one with autism which means his sleep cycle is all over the map). When I am awakened, I am usually moving around (taking kids to the toilet, changing night-time nappies, soothing kids with bad dreams, switching beds to better quieten a kid so the rest of the house can sleep, getting a glass of water, etc.). I also use the Surge automatic sleep recording feature to track my sleep. I don\\'t want to have to sstart or stop recording anything manually.   On many nights, if I get up, the Surge will create multiple sleep logs. At 4am, it has done this when I have been awake for 9 minutes or more. At 7am, it has done this when I have been up for less than a minute - and yes, sometimes I go back to bed after 7am while my wife takes over after my nighttime \"shift\". These multiple sleep logs are inaccurate because that 9 minutes, or 1 minute, or whatever it is isn\\'t counted as awake time.   All I need is a single command to merge the multiple logs into a single log with the gaps between logs calculated as awake time. This would solve all the display issues with multiple logs, and give me a much clearer view of my entire night. I would have a single sleep pattern graph and a single sleep log calculation.

       "  'My suggestion is specific to the existing \"Sleep Goals\" functionality in the app.   The current functionality is very manual and not very insightful or helpful. For example, I have to manually specify my Sleep Goal (time asleep in hours/minutes), and separately I manually specify my Target Sleep Schedule by entering Bedtime and Wake up Time.  Whatever you enter for Target Sleep Schedule isn\\'t in any way connected to your sleep goal.   My suggestion is to make the app more helpful by incorporating logic to the Target Sleep Schedule functionality in the app in order to help you meet your sleep goal.  Specifically, the app should be able to calculate the Target Sleep Schedule Bedtime after you enter your Time Asleep Goal and Wake up Time.   For example: Let\\'s say I set my Time Asleep Goal to 8 hours of sleep per night.  I specify my Target Sleep Schedule Wake up Time as 7:00am. On average looking at my sleep data I spend roughly 1 hour per night restless/awake.   It should be smart enough to automatically calculate what time you should go to bed in order to meet your sleep goal.  The formula is very simple:  Wake Up Time - (Time Asleep Goal + Avg Time Awake/Restless)   Using my specific example above, I specify a Time Asleep Goal of 8 hours, and my sleep data suggests I spend an hour on average restless/awake each night.  That means I need 8+1 = 9 hours of time in bed in order to meet my Time Asleep Goal of 8 hours.  If I specify 7:00am as my Wake up Time, then to calculate Bedtime would be 7:00am - 9 hours = 10:00pm the night before. This means in order to meet my sleep goal for the night, I need to be in bed no later than 10pm. The app should be smart enough to automatically calculate 10:00pm as my Sleep Schedule Bedtime instead of forcing the user to manually do the math to figure out their sleep schedule.',\n",

I was really suprised to see it had given me almost 8,000 steps, 3.24 miles, 134 floors, & way more calories thank I burned while I was sitting in my car.  I looked on the forum to see how to easily delete the steps, miles, floors, and calories so my data would be accurate.  The only way people are fixing it is by manually logging the activity \"Automobile or light truck (not a semi) driving\" and entering in the duration.  I think that is a cumbersome way to fix the issue everytime I drive because I have to make sure I write down what time I get into and out of my car so I know the start time and duration.  And how does it automatically know the calories burned when everyone burns calories when they are sedentary at different rates.   I think they should add a \"Drive Mode\" feature that when turned on it won\\'t add steps, distance, floors, & will only add calories burned equal to you sitting in a chair.   You could access the \"Drive Mode\" either on your Fitbit One or on your phone app to turn it on/off.  If you have a Fitbit One you could press the button till the \"Drive Mode\" icon appears then hold the button down for 2 seconds to turn it on or off.     On the phone apps you would just go to your device under \"Account\" and there you could turn it on or off.

By adding support for this, we could create a richer user experience.   It would also be easier to use 'path' elements to draw certain objects that currently require image files (e.g. images of a heart, footsteps, stairs etc.). Image files also use more memory than would be required by an equivalent svg 'path' definition.   Svg 'path' is also more flexible than an image. For example, there are currently two 'heart' images in Fitbit OS. One is a solid heart while the other is a heart outline. Both of these could easily be reproduced using a single svg path element and changing a single attribute to switch between a solid or outline heart.   Svg elements can also be scaled and rendered any size without losing quality. Currently, if you want differently sized images, you will either have a 'large' image that is then scaled down to the required size, or several differently sized images.

I'm suggesting a two-part solution:   (1) Allow apps to register a background process function that the FitBit device calls on a regular basis, even when the app is not running. The app would indicate its desired wake-up frequency, but FitBit might want to set a maximum wake-up frequency to limit resource usage.   (2) Allow apps to drop messages into the notification queue that FitBit displays above the clock face. This allows apps to provide notifications without having to write a phone app to push them, which would further clutter the phone's own notification queue.   The max wake-up frequency would determine the kinds of apps that users could write. Once-an-hour wake-up would allow apps to provide reports or reminders. Once-every-N-minutes wake-up would allow apps to monitor progress and make suggestions or provide encouragement. Once-every-minute (or faster) would allow apps to provide real time notifications. Absent this feature, app developers are forced to write their own clock apps to provide app notification services, even when a novelty clock isn't the point of the app. Alternatively, app devs could write mobile phone apps that issue app notices to the FitBit watch, but this clutters up the phone's notification queue. At present, this latter approach also requires round-tripping between the phone app and an Internet server in order to communicate with the companion.   Also, it's ideal that the app be able to do this without the phone (companion) present, so that people can rely on the FitBit without having to always have the phone around.
